 Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.
(ie, from left to right, level by level).  For example: Given binary tree
{3,9,20,#,#,15,7} ,  3
/ \
9  20
/  \
15   7   return its level order traversal as:  [
[3],
[9,20],
[15,7]
]   confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? > read more on how binary tree is
serialized on OJ.  OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:  The serialization of a
binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path
terminator where no node exists below.  Here's an example:  1

2   3

5 The above binary tree is serialized as "{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}" .    Subscribe to
