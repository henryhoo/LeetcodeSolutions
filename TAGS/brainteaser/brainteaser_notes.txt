******************************nim-game
 You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of
stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones.
The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first
turn to remove the stones.  Both of you are very clever and have optimal
strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the
game given the number of stones in the heap.  For example, if there are 4 stones
in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you
remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.   If there are 5
stones in the heap, could you figure out a way to remove the stones such that
you will always be the winner?   Credits: Special thanks to @jianchao.li.fighter

******************************bulb-switcher
 There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs.
Then, you turn off every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every third
bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the i th round, you
toggle every i bulb. For the n th round, you only toggle the last bulb.
Find how many bulbs are on after n rounds.   Example:  Given n = 3. At first,
the three bulbs are [off, off, off] .
After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on] .
After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on] .
After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off] . So you should return 1,
because there is only one bulb is on.   Subscribe to see which companies asked
