/*
 Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of
s .  For example,  s = "anagram", t = "nagaram", return true.  s = "rat", t =
"car", return false.  Note: You may assume the string contains only lowercase
alphabets.  Follow up: What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would
you adapt your solution to such case?   Subscribe to see which companies asked
