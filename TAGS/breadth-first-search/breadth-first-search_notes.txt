 There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1 .
Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to
first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]  Given the total number
of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs , return the ordering of courses you
should take to finish all courses.  There may be multiple correct orders, you
just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses,
return an empty array.  For example:  2, [[1,0]]  There are a total of 2 courses
to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct
course order is [0,1]  4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]  There are a total of 4
courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2.
Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. So one correct
course order is [0,1,2,3] . Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .  Note: The

******************************minimum-height-trees
 For a undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the
root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees,
those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs).
Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of
their root labels.   Format The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0
to n - 1 .
You will be given the number n and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a
pair of labels).  You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges .
Since all edges are
undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in
edges .   Example 1:   Given n = 4 , edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]   0

/ \
2   3  return [1]    Example 2:   Given n = 6 , edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3],

According to the definition
of tree on Wikipedia : “a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices
are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without
simple cycles is a tree.”  (2) The height of a rooted tree is the number of
edges on the longest downward path between the root and a
leaf.  Credits: Special thanks to @dietpepsi for adding this problem and

******************************clone-graph
 Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list
of its neighbors .    OJ's undirected graph serialization:  Nodes are labeled
uniquely. We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node
label and each neighbor of the node.  As an example, consider the serialized
graph { 0 ,1,2# 1 ,2# 2 ,2} .  The graph has a total of three nodes, and
therefore contains three parts as separated by # .  First node is labeled as 0 .
Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2 .  Second node is labeled as 1 . Connect
node 1 to node 2 .  Third node is labeled as 2 . Connect node 2 to node 2
(itself), thus forming a self-cycle.    Visually, the graph looks like the
following: 1
