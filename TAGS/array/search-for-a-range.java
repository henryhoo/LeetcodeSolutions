/*
 Given a sorted array of integers, find the starting and ending position of a
given target value.  Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of
O (log n ).  If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1] .  For
example, Given [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10] and target value 8, return [3, 4] .
