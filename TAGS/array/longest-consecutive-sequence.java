/*
 Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive
elements sequence.  For example, Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2] , The longest
consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] . Return its length: 4 .  Your
algorithm should run in O( n ) complexity.   Subscribe to see which companies
