/*
 Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s , find the
minimal length of a subarray of which the sum ≥ s . If there isn't one, return 0
instead.  For example, given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7 , the subarray
[4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.  click to show more
practice.  More practice:  If you have figured out the O ( n ) solution, try
coding another solution of which the time complexity is O ( n log n ).
