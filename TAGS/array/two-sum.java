/*
 Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they
add up to a specific target.  You may assume that each input would have exactly
one solution.   Example:  Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[ 0 ] + nums[ 1 ] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [ 0 , 1 ].    UPDATE (2016/2/13): The return format had been changed to
zero-based indices. Please read the above updated description carefully.
