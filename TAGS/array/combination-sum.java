/*
 Given a set of candidate numbers ( C ) and a target number ( T ), find all
unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T .  The same
repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.  Note:   All
numbers (including target) will be positive integers.  Elements in a combination
( a 1 , a 2 , … , a k ) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a 1 ≤ a 2 ≤ … ≤ a
k ).  The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.    For example,
given candidate set 2,3,6,7 and target 7 , A solution set is:  [7]   [2, 2, 3]
