/*
 Given a set of distinct integers, nums , return all possible subsets.  Note:
Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.  The solution set must not
contain duplicate subsets.    For example, If nums = [1,2,3] , a solution is:  [
[3],
[1],
[2],
[1,2,3],
[1,3],
[2,3],
[1,2],
[]
