/*
 Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a , b , c , and d in S such
that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which
gives the sum of target.  Note:   Elements in a quadruplet ( a , b , c , d )
must be in non-descending order. (ie, a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d )  The solution set must not
contain duplicate quadruplets.    For example, given array S = {1 0 -1 0 -2 2},
and target = 0.
A solution set is:
(-1,  0, 0, 1)
(-2, -1, 1, 2)
(-2,  0, 0, 2)   Subscribe to see which companies asked this question    Show
