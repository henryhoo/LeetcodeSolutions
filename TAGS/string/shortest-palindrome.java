 Given a string S, you are allowed to convert it to a palindrome by adding
characters in front of it. Find and return the shortest palindrome you can find
by performing this transformation.  For example:  Given "aacecaaa" , return
"aaacecaaa" .  Given "abcd" , return "dcbabcd" .  Credits: Special thanks to
