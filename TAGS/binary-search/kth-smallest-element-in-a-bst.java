/*
 Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the k th
smallest element in it.  Note: You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's
total elements.  Follow up: What if the BST is modified (insert/delete
operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would
you optimize the kthSmallest routine?   Try to utilize the property of a BST.
What if you could modify the BST node's structure?  The optimal runtime
complexity is O(height of BST).   Credits: Special thanks to @ts for adding this
problem and creating all test cases.   Subscribe to see which companies asked
