/*
 Given a collection of candidate numbers ( C ) and a target number ( T ), find
all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T .  Each
number in C may only be used once in the combination.  Note:   All numbers
(including target) will be positive integers.  Elements in a combination ( a 1 ,
a 2 , … , a k ) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a 1 ≤ a 2 ≤ … ≤ a k ).
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.    For example, given
candidate set 10,1,2,7,6,1,5 and target 8 , A solution set is:  [1, 7]   [1, 2,
5]   [2, 6]   [1, 1, 6]     Subscribe to see which companies asked this question
