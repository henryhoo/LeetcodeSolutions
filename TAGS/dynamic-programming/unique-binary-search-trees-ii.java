/*
 Given n , generate all structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that
store values 1... n .  For example, Given n = 3, your program should return all
5 unique BST's shown below. 1         3     3      2      1
\       /     /      / \      \
3     2     1      1   3      2
/     /       \                 \

more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.  OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:
The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#'
signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.  Here's an example:  1
/ \
2   3

4

5 The above binary tree is serialized as "{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}" .    Subscribe to
