/*
 Given a 2D matrix matrix , find the sum of the elements inside the rectangle
defined by its upper left corner ( row 1, col 1) and lower right corner ( row 2,
col 2).    The above rectangle (with the red border) is defined by (row1, col1)
= (2, 1) and (row2, col2) = (4, 3) , which contains sum = 8 .   Example:  Given
matrix = [
[3, 0, 1, 4, 2],
[5, 6, 3, 2, 1],
[1, 2, 0, 1, 5],
[4, 1, 0, 1, 7],
[1, 0, 3, 0, 5]
]
sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 8
sumRegion(1, 1, 2, 2) -> 11
sumRegion(1, 2, 2, 4) -> 12   Note:   You may assume that the matrix does not
change.  There are many calls to sumRegion function.  You may assume that row 1
&le; row 2 and col 1 &le; col 2.     Subscribe to see which companies asked this
