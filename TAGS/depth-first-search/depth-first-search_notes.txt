******************************reconstruct-itinerary
 Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival
airports [from, to] , reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets
belong to a man who departs from JFK . Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK .
Note:   If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary
that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example,
the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"] .
All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).  You may
assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.     Example 1:  tickets =
[["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]] Return ["JFK",
"MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"] .    Example 2:  tickets =
[["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]] Return
["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"] . Another possible reconstruction is
["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] . But it is larger in lexical order.

houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the
police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

 There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1 .

of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs , return the ordering of courses you
should take to finish all courses.  There may be multiple correct orders, you
just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses,
return an empty array.  For example:  2, [[1,0]]  There are a total of 2 courses
to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct
course order is [0,1]  4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]  There are a total of 4
courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2.
Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. So one correct
course order is [0,1,2,3] . Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .  Note: The

matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented .  click to show more
