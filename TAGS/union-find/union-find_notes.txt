******************************longest-consecutive-sequence
 Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive
elements sequence.  For example, Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2] , The longest
consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] . Return its length: 4 .  Your
algorithm should run in O( n ) complexity.   Subscribe to see which companies

******************************number-of-islands
 Given a 2d grid map of '1' s (land) and '0' s (water), count the number of
islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent
lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are
all surrounded by water.  Example 1:  11110 11010 11000 00000  Answer: 1
Example 2:  11000 11000 00100 00011  Answer: 3  Credits: Special thanks to

******************************surrounded-regions
 Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' , capture all regions surrounded by 'X'
.  A region is captured by flipping all 'O' s into 'X' s in that surrounded
region.  For example,  X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X   After running your function, the board should be: X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X    Subscribe to see which companies asked this question    Show Tags
